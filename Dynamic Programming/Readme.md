# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, solving each once, and storing the results. Use DP when a problem has **optimal substructure** (optimal solution builds on optimal sub-solutions) and **overlapping subproblems** (same subproblems recurrently appear).
