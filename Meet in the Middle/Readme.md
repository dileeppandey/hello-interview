# Meet in the Middle

Meet in the middle is used when input is small, but not that small that it can be solved using brute force.

Mostly used for algorithms having exponential complexity. Meet in the middle is not recursion, as you cannot solve the problem by combining the smaller instances of the same problem.

Try to divide the problem, and come up with a clever way to combine the solution of the two problems for better run time.

## Problems

* 4 Sum II [[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum-ii/)] [[Solution](FourSumCount/)] [[Thinking](FourSumCount/THINKING.md)]

* Given a prime number and p, q two integers between 0 and n - 1. find k such that p^k = q (mod n)
* Friend a of a friend: Given two users in a social network, design efficient method to find if one is a friend of a friend of other.
* Equal partition: Given a set A of n real numbers, split A into two sets of equal sum.
* Minimal Vertex Cover: Given a graph of n nodes, find out a set with the smallest number of vertices such that each edge in the graph has at least one node inside the set.
