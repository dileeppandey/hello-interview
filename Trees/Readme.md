# Binary Tree And Binary Search Tree

* Traversals using Recursion and Iteration
  * inorder
  * preorder
  * posrorder
* Maximum depth of a binary tree.
* Insert an element in:
  * binary tree
  * binary search tree
* Delete an element from:
  * binary tree
  * binary search tree
* Check if a binary tree is symmetric. [[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)] [[Solution]()]
* Check if Binary Tree is BST.
* Least Common Ancestor:
  * of a binary tree.
  * of a binary search tree.
* Balance a Tree:
  * check if a binary tree is balanced.
  * balance a given binary tree.
  * balance a binary search tree.
* Restore the original binary search tree if two of the nodes are swapped.
* Construct binary tree from given inorder and preorder traversals.
* Given a pointer to a node in a binary search tree, returns a pointer to the next node in the in-order traversal of the tree.
