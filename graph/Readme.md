# Graph

Graph algorithms for traversal, shortest path, cycle detection, and connected components.

## Traversals
* BFS (Breadth-First Search) [[Solution](bfs/)] [[Thinking](bfs/THINKING.md)]
* DFS (Depth-First Search) [[Solution](dfs/)] [[Thinking](dfs/THINKING.md)]

## Problems
* Number of Islands [[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)] [[Solution](number_of_islands/)] [[Thinking](number_of_islands/THINKING.md)]
* Course Schedule (Cycle Detection) [[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)] [[Solution](course_schedule/)] [[Thinking](course_schedule/THINKING.md)]
