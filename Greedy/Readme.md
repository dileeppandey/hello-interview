# Greedy

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. They work when a problem has the **greedy choice property** (a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution) and **optimal substructure** (an optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems).
